title: "Manachers Algorithm Longest Palindromic Substring"
description: "
One of the most interesting algorithms is to find the longest palindromic substring in O(n) time. A palindrome is a string that is the same when reversed. For example, `Dr. Awkward` is a palindrome. If we remove non alphanumeric characters and make each character lower case, it becomes "drawkward" which is the same when reversed. For more information, you can look at [Manacher's Algorithm wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring).

For this post, I found one of the most useful explanations of the algorithm. You can watch it below. I've also made a summary for people who just want a quick reminder.
