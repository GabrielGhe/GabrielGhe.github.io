While working on an iOS app, I needed to have a TableView that was searchable. After looking it up, I found out that
I could use a Table View and add a Search Bar and Search Display.

First we drag and drop a UIViewController to our storyboard.
Then we drag and drop a Table View inside that ViewController and a Search Bar and Search Display above the TableView

```swift
