<h3>Overview</h3>

Every great IDE has intellisence/autocomplete. The best one, in my opinion, is Visual Studio whose autocomplete and reference indicators are priceless. XCode has some pretty good autocomplete too, the issue is that, while it works great for Objective-C, it does not work very well with Swift.

To force autocomplete to launch, press `Control + Space`.
