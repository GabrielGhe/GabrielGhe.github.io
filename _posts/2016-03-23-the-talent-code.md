I recently read a book by Daniel Coyle called [The Talent Code](https://www.amazon.ca/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X). It talks about the famous 10000 hour rule to mastering a skill and how to achieve those 10000s efficiently.

While some people may have a natural talent. That talent is useless in the long run. The secret to becoming skilled at something is a neural insulator called myelin. In our brains, we have neurons that have nerve fibers. These fibers send signals to other neurons and that's what tells our body to move or speak or dance. 

Myelin wraps around these fibers and makes them faster, more precise and efficient. The more we perform a task, the more myelin is wrapped around those fibers. A pianist or tennis player has a large amount of myelin wrapped around the fibers he/she uses most.

I highly recommend reading [The Talent Code](https://www.amazon.ca/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X) as it changed the way I look at practicing and made me more efficient.

There are 3 parts to learning effectively: deep practice, ignition and master coaching.

To achieve the most effective practice session, it is important to break down the problem into tiny steps. Try to make mistakes and learn from them.
