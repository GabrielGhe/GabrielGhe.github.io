description: "
I recently read a book by Stephen Covey called [7 habits of highly effective people](https://www.amazon.ca/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1462136808&sr=1-1&keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people). In this post, I'll list the different things I learned form the book.
