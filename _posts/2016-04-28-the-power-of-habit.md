title: "The Power of Habit"
description: "
I recently read a book by charles duhigg called [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X). It talks about how people can create new habits and how powerful habits can be. I want to talk about the two things I learned from this book.

<!-- Lesson 1 -->
<h4>Lesson 1</h4>

All habits can be broken down into 3 parts initially and 1 more part appears over time. 

- Habits are triggered by <b>cues</b>
- Which activate a <b>routine</b>
- Ending with a <b>reward</b>
- Over time, you develop a <b>craving</b> for this habit

If you don't trigger the cue, then you don't perform the habit. So you want to avoid triggering the bad cues and find ways to trigger the good cues more often.

The craving appears over time and just like Pavlov's dog, you get start getting that dopamine reward right after the cue instead of getting it at the end of the routine.


<!-- Lesson 2 -->
<h4>Lesson 2</h4>

All cues fall into 1 of 5 categories.

- Time
- Location
- Last Action
- Emotion (state)
- Others (and their actions)
