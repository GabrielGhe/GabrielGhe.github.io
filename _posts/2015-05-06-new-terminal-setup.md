Getting a new computer is awesome, but you have to set up your work environment all over again. For macs, this is what I do to set up my terminal.

I really like to modify files in sublime, so that's the first thing I get. I download it from [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

I have to set up the `subl` command in the terminal so that when I want to open a file or a directory, I simply run `subl filename`.
